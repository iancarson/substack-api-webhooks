# Limitations and Platform Reality

This repo is intentionally honest about what a substack api webhooks can and cannot do.

## Core Constraints

- **Post scheduling API**: Not exposed as a complete public product API. Risk level: High.
- **Webhook callbacks**: No universal official webhook surface for third-party schedulers. Risk level: High.
- **RSS/import workflows**: Supported for migration and reading use cases. Risk level: Low.
- **Subscriber attribution**: Requires platform-side analytics or owned tracking. Risk level: Medium.
- **Production retry queue**: Application responsibility. Risk level: Medium.

## Common Failure Modes

- OAuth tokens expire or lose permissions after platform security changes.
- Browser/session-based automations break when the platform updates UI or anti-abuse rules.
- Scheduled jobs publish duplicate content if idempotency keys are missing.
- Medium and Substack workflows need special handling because their public write surfaces are not equivalent to LinkedIn, X, Bluesky, or Threads.
- A generic social post can damage performance when it ignores platform-native formatting.

## Safe Implementation Principles

1. Use official APIs and documented permissions where they exist.
2. Keep credentials server-side and rotate them safely.
3. Preview every platform payload before scheduling.
4. Use idempotency keys for every write request.
5. Emit webhook events for success, failure, and reconnect states.
6. Avoid presenting unsupported platform behavior as official API capability.
